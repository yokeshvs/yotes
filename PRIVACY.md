# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2025-12-14

## Introduction
The "Yotes" mobile application ("App") is a non-commercial, open-source project designed for personal note-taking.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.**
*   All notes and data created within the App are stored locally on your device.
*   The App does not connect to any external servers to transmit user content.
*   The App does not use any third-party analytics or tracking services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase).

## Third-Party Services
Since the App functions entirely offline and does not have a backend, no third-party services process your data.
